One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).\\n\\nSheri\\n\\nWhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a \"Dateline\" type theme for one, and a \"60 Minute\" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)? \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nCheers Kirk\\n---------------------- '"

       "\"so according to your analysis, had we been at $2.5 gas and we were not \\nbordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of \\nrecorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf?  seems a \\nlittle far fetched to me.  Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have \\nhad 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residential \\nindustrial switching processing...    \\nas far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was \\nextremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be \\nrunning every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe \\n5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west from \\nwaha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really havent \\nreached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where \\ngas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern of \\nmore efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to build \\nthe stack now to estimate.  \\nfrac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  will \\ncontinue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  bordering \\nright there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise \\n100,000 last week as gas got to parity.  \\nlet me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty from \\nengineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen \\ndemand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts.\\nbo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  really \\ninactive.\\nto clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the inj \\nnumbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that starts \\nto clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little short \\nright now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller though\\nnot really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense.  \\nhowever as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to \\ngreat in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other.  \\nnotice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday?\\nin general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50 \\ncents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.  \\nmarket needs to see some big stg numbers first.   \\ni think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads.  \\nJan 4/3.5 look great to me.  if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last \\nyear's early weather, bombs away.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nslafontaine@globalp.com on 03/03/2001 07:03:14 AM\\nTo: jarnold@enron.com\\ncc:  \\nSubject: friday\\n\\n\\n\\nthis doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requires\\npower px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient,\\nweather of course. but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak in\\njuly-shud be marginal in apr-jun\\n   if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction is\\nimplied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guys \\nlike\\nme turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will be\\nless factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&d swing will\\nbe closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think\\nwe'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner\\n     now rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.00 ie february which is approx \\nwhere\\nwe are today\\n    all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i consider\\nextraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occured\\nbefore-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ie\\nliquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel. some\\nammonia/fert prod  has come back as well. but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/d\\nindustrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as mucha\\nunction of an economic slowdown.\\n    anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your \\nbig\\nfund customers(ospraie). we'll see.  is collins bullish as well-he seems \\nquieter\\nin the mkt lately.\\n  heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is\\non a weekly basis? we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 then\\nmeans the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and\\nbe unable to inject all the gas available? thots\\n    also, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ct\\ndiscount lately daily vs next month futs? why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get it \\nbt\\nwondering if its transportation or storage cost related.\\n  have a good weekdn my man\\n\\n---------------------- \""

Additionally, the start and end dates will \\nskue the valuation based on which day of the week the first calendar day of \\nthe month falls on and which day of the week the last calendar day of the \\nmonth falls on. Using a straight 5/7 valuation methodology is only going to \\nget you 'close' to true value in the Position Summary. Hence, the specs sent \\nto Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built.\\n\\nIn short, Eol was not set up to readily accept this valuation methodology. We \\nwill get you as close as we can, and we will give you some idea of how close \\nthese Position Values will be. \\n\\nAlso, can you confirm that you intent to always and ONLY trade this Product \\nduring bid week? \\n\\nDale\\n\\n---------------------- \""

NES represents that the NES Facility will eventually include 2,700 MW \\nof capacity, to be constructed in individual increments of 300 MW.  According \\nto NES, the NES Facility will be the first compressed air energy storage \\nproject to be developed in North America as a merchant facility, and only the \\nthird CAES facility in the world.  NES states that the NES Facility will \\nemploy an innovative technology that will allow NES to &store8 electric \\nenergy produced in one period for delivery, resale and use during a later \\nperiod, much as a pumped storage hydroelectric facility does.  \\n\\nFull notice below.\\n---------------------- '"

Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, \\npending agreement from the Office of the Chair.\\n2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be \\nsigned off by risk management before end of day.\\n3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a \\ncomparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's \\nportfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to \\nbe reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )\\n4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be \\nreported to technical support in the event of a failure.  \\n\\nThe benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time \\nfor completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning \\nof the next trading day.\\n\\nEarly in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each \\nbusiness area/valuation system for the following:\\na) current state\\nb) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking\\nc) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - \\nMarket Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - \\nimplementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )\\n\\nUpon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full \\ncommercial signoff\\n\\nRegards\\n\\nMike Jordan, James New, Mark Pickering, John Paskin and Brian Hudson\\n---------------------- \""

       "\"The past two years, Enron has offered a very effective two-day session called \\nExecutive Influence and Impact.  This is required of everyone at the VP level \\nand above, and participation is definitely tracked.  I thought that the class \\nwas very helpful.  360 feedback is solicited prior to the session and is used \\nin a very constructive and focused way to help each participant target two to \\nthree areas in which specific actions will be targeted to improve on the \\nparticipant's leadership in communicating with and motivating employees.  \\n\\nEnron will now offer this course tailored for Directors and Senior \\nDirectors.   I would like to have all directors and senior directors in our \\norganization take advantage of this opportunity.  Unfortunately, I didn't \\nfind out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot \\nout a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors.  I want to \\nwork with the entire management team to create that plan, as sessions will be \\noffered in May, September, November and February (2002).  \\n\\nHowever, today is the deadline for registering participants for the first \\nsession, May 16 and 17.  This will be given in Houston.  I would like to have \\nseveral participants from our team in this first session.  My suggestion \\nwould be that Brenda Herod and James Scribner attend as senior directors and \\nthat we also extend this opportunity to Shona Wilson and Thresa Allen as \\ndirectors.  I have asked Hector to secure four spots for us, using these \\nnames as participants.  If this timing does not work, please let me know and \\nwe can determine who could be substituted for the May session.  We would have \\nto name a sub right away, so please get back with me ASAP and confirm that \\nthe four names that I have suggested will be able to attend, or let me know \\nyour recommendation on a substitution.  \\nThanks. \\n---------------------- \""

       "\"Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark \\nTaylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right \\nthing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the \\nservice to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as \\nsoon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs \\nregularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider \\nthe following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary \\nwhen you meet with Mark.\\n\\nFirst, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial \\nconfirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that \\ntime, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  \\nWe now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in \\nHouston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  \\n\\nSecond, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by \\nHouston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep \\naudit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent \\nout after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are \\nperiodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in \\nthe confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the \\nconfirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the \\nconfirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big \\nproblem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, \\nwhich is even a bigger problem.  \\n\\nThird, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston \\ngenerate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the \\ntransactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the \\nconfirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by \\nlegal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if \\ndone by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron \\nNorth America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the \\ncounterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of \\nexecution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the \\nfollow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary \\noffice.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same \\npre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where \\nthere is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, \\nor, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare \\nour own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element \\nof risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are \\nwe allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?\\n\\nFourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in \\nHouston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has \\nstaff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are \\nreviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, \\nroute them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is \\ncomplete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on \\nissues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading \\ncompany financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the \\ntransactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these \\ndocuments.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for \\nthe financial confirmations without adding any staff.\\n\\nFifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the \\nconfirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  \\nBecause of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the \\nconfirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the \\ntransaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the \\nfinancial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.\\n\\nFinally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my \\nexisting employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the \\ncompany in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of \\nthe documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas \\nsuch as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to \\nkeep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the \\nconfirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already \\nexists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full \\naccountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity \\nto develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.\\n\\nAs a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring \\nthat all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function \\nproperly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to \\nget your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this \\nfunction to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the \\nimpression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I \\nhope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to \\nlook at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that \\nexists here.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in \\nthis memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very \\nstrongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please \\nlet me know how your meeting with Mark goes.\\n\\nThanks,\\nPeggy  \\n\\n\\n   \\n\\tEnron North America Corp.\\n\\t\\n\\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           07/19/2000 04:57 PM\\n\\t\\n\\nTo: Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\nSubject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  \\n\\nI got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in \\nthe office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night).  \\nTogether we will do two things:  (1) devise a foolproof plan to insure an \\nexcellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately, and (2) work with \\nMark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation \\npreparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns.

First and foremost, \\nthe process of creating a standard risk metric belongs to RAC, I believe.  To \\nme this is no different than VAR, or the Capital Pricing methodololgy, or the \\nRAROC process.   This has been published without even a review from our \\ngroup, which I think is inappropriate for two reasons: 1) we might disagree \\nand, as stated above, I think we have the final say, and 2) we can\\'t quality \\ncontrol it and all the reciepients think that I have.  Second, this has been \\ndeveloped in isolation when in fact we have been doing similar things for the \\npast 2 years. We report these to the Board and have published to the Desk \\nheads on a monthly basis returns by trader.  Clearly, there could have been \\nsome benefit in each direction if we were told that this was a goal of this \\ngroup, particularly when we fundamentally agree that this group should be \\ndoing these things.  Thirdly, it is a little irritating when someone sets up \\na process in isolation for what may appear to be \"show-time\" when my group is \\nspending hours and hours analyzing the output of existing process because the \\ndata integrity is so bad (double mapping of portfolios, books not \\nofficialized......) - we have at least attempted to take both parts of the \\nequation, Eugenio has chosen to focus on the cool part.  Now I would be a \\nlittle less concerned if on almost every day, Eugenio wasn\\'t in my morning \\nmeeting contributing virtually nothing, i.e., this doesn\\'t appear to be \\noversight on his part.\\n\\nI would prefer to not make a big deal out of this, but rather take it as an \\nopportunity to clarify and shift some responsibilities.

Before \\nWillie went into SAP to net the payable (same day), SAP crashed.  By the time \\nSAP came up, the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired the \\ncash.  When we issued the recall, the money was already out the door.\\n\\nAs a result, we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for \\nnetout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in Unify.  \\nThis causes them to be blocked in SAP and not picked up by treasury until the \\npayment block is removed.  This policy went into effect at the beginning of \\nSeptember.  \\n\\nHowever, this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure \\nworks.  To ensure we don\\'t \"accidentally\" release cash, I have asked Unify IT \\nto change the interface to send all purchases for ENA to SAP blocked, which \\nwill require the coordinator to release funds.

The system was \\noriginally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the US \\nand as new markets and new ideas (such as the US becoming more and more of a \\nfinancial market) we will need to enhance Enpower to follow suit.

I believe the attached \\nsituation is an excellent example of out proactivity and mitigation of \\noperational risk.\\n\\nAs indicated below, once we learned of financial difficulties, we pulled \\ntogether a team which included Commercial to evaluate next steps.  The team \\nwent to Chicago and met with the owner of the reload facility business.  He \\nhad a financial representative present, and our concerns were validated.  The \\nowner of the business currently leases the facility from the railroad, and he \\nhas not paid his lease in 7 or 8 months.  Additionally, he has not filed \\nfederal income taxes for:  payroll, corporate or personal business.  He \\nestimates that he owes about $250M.  The facility is not fenced so our \\ninventory of about $1MM is not secured.  He did sign a one page document, \\nprepared by Enron legal, declaring that the lumber on site marked \"Enron\" was \\nin fact ours and was not owned by his company.  This was a saftey measure in \\ncase the IRS came in and started seizing inventory.  All actions were \\ninitiated by Energy Operations personnel.\\n\\nThe team also visited another facility, and in contrast to the first \\nfacility, witnessed a more sophistocated operation.  The business is \\nprivately owned and audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers  Although they would \\nnot share financial statements, PWC\\'s audit opinion was provided.  \\nAdditionally, PWC prepares the taxes also.  The team made the decision to \\nmove the inventory to the new location ASAP.  This decision was approved by \\nHouston Commercial, and efforts began to relocate the inventory.\\n\\nI feel very strongly that had we, Energy Operations, not taken the lead, the \\nCommercial team would have continued in the original facility, leaving $1MM \\nof inventory at risk.  Although they had sold about 50% of it, the inventory \\nwould not have been delivered out of the faciity until about mid-March.  \\nCommercial did not have any plans for the other 50%.  While we certainly \\ndon\\'t know if the outcome would have been negative if left in the original \\nfacility, we know that we certainly mitigated the potential risk.\\n\\nFurthermore, last week I established cross-functional weekly meetings \\nbetween:  Legal, Credit, Tax, Financial Reporting, Fundamental Analysis, IT \\nand Operations to ensure open lines of communication.  In the meeting, I \\ndiscussed this issue, and everyone agreed that we needed to develop policies \\nand procedures for warehousing facilities.  EIM currently has inventory in \\nabout 15 to 20 facilities, some internationally.  Kent Castleman has taken \\nthe lead on this.\\n\\nIf you have any questions, please let me know. \\n---------------------- '"

       "\"The past two years, Enron has offered a very effective two-day session called \\nExecutive Influence and Impact.

I would like to have all directors and senior directors in our \\norganization take advantage of this opportunity.  Unfortunately, I didn't \\nfind out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot \\nout a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors.  I want to \\nwork with the entire management team to create that plan, as sessions will be \\noffered in May, September, November and February (2002).  \\n\\nHowever, today is the deadline for registering participants for the first \\nsession, May 16 and 17.  This will be given in Houston.  I would like to have \\nseveral participants from our team in this first session.  My suggestion \\nwould be that Brenda Herod and James Scribner attend as senior directors and \\nthat we also extend this opportunity to Shona Wilson and Thresa Allen as \\ndirectors.  I have asked Hector to secure four spots for us, using these \\nnames as participants.  If this timing does not work, please let me know and \\nwe can determine who could be substituted for the May session.  We would have \\nto name a sub right away, so please get back with me ASAP and confirm that \\nthe four names that I have suggested will be able to attend, or let me know \\nyour recommendation on a substitution.  \\nThanks. \\n---------------------- \""

Subsequently an \\'all hands\\' meeting was called to \\ndiscuss the operational issues and the business imperatives of \\nOff Balance Sheet Facility (\"OBSF\") renegotiation\\nMinimising working captial\\nSAP implementation\\nThe notes of that meeting are also attached at the bottom of this email\\n\\nShould you require any further information please call, otherwise I will \\nforward updates as they are completed.\\n\\nRegards\\n\\nMike\\n\\n\\n\\nISSUE\\n\\nThe Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure \\n(OBSF) pre year-end to meet Enron requirements for gearing ratios.\\n\\nWhilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being \\nbearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value of \\nwhich depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given the \\nhard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially \\ntook place on spreadsheets.\\n\\nThe impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business \\nshould not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on \\nbalance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlements, \\nparticularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in \\nthe AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all \\noperational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed \\nsatisfactorily.\\n\\nThe core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released \\nduring January but was subsequently found to have introduced +bugs, to the \\nintegrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no \\nOBSF functionality, the +bugs, have had an increasingly negative effect on \\nthe control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a \\nguaranteed delivery for the +bug, fixes and non core ,reporting, \\nfunctionality.\\n\\nThis has given rise to the following concerns:\\n\\n? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at a \\nbrand & location level to coordination records (the global position is \\nreconciled however).\\n? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as:\\n? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash to \\n3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimated, \\nand\\n? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.\\n\\nThese concerns are compounded by the following:\\n\\n? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has \\nresigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in \\nJuly 2001.\\n?

I confirmed with Ted, the traders are accountable for providing \\nthe explanation.  I\\'m not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back \\nto your efforts of getting memos out earlier.

It should be the traders \\nresponsibility to get them to you, and they should be reviewing their \\npositions every morning before they even begin trading., and should be able \\nto easily explain why they\\'re in violation or why they had a big loss.  \\nWhether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail, or they \\ntalk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you \\n- whatever you think makes sense and works for you.   I\\'m not trying to \\nmanage the process, just to help design one that makes it easier for you and \\nis still effective from a risk management stand point.\\n\\nAt this point in this long series of e-mails, why don\\'t we just talk face to \\nface.

We can talk \\nabout this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RAC\\'s \\nexpectations.  I agree, we do have significant mid-office needs, and you have \\nbeen absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC;  \\nand my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk \\nreporting is required every day by Skilling.  We can continue to work on \\nstreamlining processes, but maybe we need to think about staffing in our \\nrespective groups and corresponding responsibilities.  I\\'m willing to do \\nwhatever is needed, and I don\\'t think Ted is hung up on who does what \\neither.  It\\'s just that right now we\\'re staffed with the expectation that \\nSally\\'s group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of \\nactivities related to our risk management systems.\\n\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nCassandra.\\n\\n\\n---------------------- '"

These margin calls / returns of margin are monitored and amounts \\nsigned off on by the RAC Credit Group (Bill Bradford\\'s area).   Backup from \\nthe Credit group should  be and is included with each wire.\\n\\nI would appreciate your consideration of the above arguments to facilitate \\nthe movement of these monies on a go-forward basis.  I will call you tomorrow \\nto discuss the possibility of having this change in effect for Monday Dec. \\n11.  Thank you.\\n\\n        Greg x35399\\n\\n---------------------- '"
